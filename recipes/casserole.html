        <p>King Ranch chicken is a Tex-Mex casserole with unknown origins, though it's assumed the dish is named
            after
            King
            Ranch, Texas. The casserole consists of pulled chicken, canned soup, green chiles, corn tortillas, sour
            cream,
            veggies, and lots of cheese. </p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Saute onion and bell peppers in the hot oil until warmed
                through, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Add both cans of condensed soup, diced tomatoes with chile peppers, chicken broth, sour cream,
                cumin, ancho chile powder, oregano, and chipotle chile powder; mix until sauce is well-combined.
            </li>
            <li>Spread a few tablespoons of sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer with 1/2 of the
                chicken, 1/2 of the sauce, 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese, and 1/2 of the tortillas.</li>
            <li>Spread the remaining chicken over the tortillas. Spread all but 1/2 cup of the remaining sauce over
                the chicken, then top with another 1/3 of the Cheddar, and the remaining tortillas. Spread the
                remaining 1/2 cup over top, and sprinkle with the remaining Cheddar.</li>
            <li>Bake casserole in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 40 minutes.</li>
